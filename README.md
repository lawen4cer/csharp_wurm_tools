# Wurm Tools

Currently only supports automation in mining. The automation is limited as the tools do not interact with the game at all. The tools are sending timed keystrokes to the active window. This is very nice for leveling up your mining skill. This application requires .NET Framework v4.7.2 or higher installed on your PC. 

If you don't have .NET Framework v4.7.2 or higher, download it here https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472

Install instructions:
